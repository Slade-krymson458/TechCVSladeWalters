        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>From Humble Beginings..</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I grew up in a small town called Toekomsrus situated in Randfontein, a mining city in West Rand, Gauteng, South Africa, just 40Km west of Johannesburg. I attended school at TownView High, in Krugersdorp and graduated in 2016 with a bachelors admission in which I studied Information Technology at the North West University.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>The 5 year journey for a 3 year degree..</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Now I know what you are thinking "How could a job seeker be bold enough to share this small detail most people would find difficult to
            
            share with employers".. So, to satisfy your curiosity the simple answer would be adversity, allow me to elucidate. like most first years,I struggled to adapt and was also very shy. I had to learn how to get out of my 
            comfort zone as soon as possible. The first time I encounted programming was in my second semester where I got introduced to "Java" object oriented programming. Being a prerequisite module, meant that I had to pass in order to do my other programming languages for the academic years to follow.</p>
            <br>
           <p> "FAILURE", a word I would had to get used to for the next two years as I had to do the module that hindered me and made my years at NWU feel like an eternity. They say the third times the charm  and thats exactly the case for me. In my third year I managed to get through and as evident on my academic transcript my marks improved gradually as I also over came external factors that played a part in my failures. After I overcame all my obstacles, the very programming language that seemed like the instrument of my damnation, ultimately became the instrument of my salvation. Meaning that after successfully completing my second year "Java" with good marks, it improved my confidence and I also found a liking in programming.</p>
        
            <br>
            <p>Although it was difficult I managed to grow, and with that growth I  became so versatile that I could later on adapt to any situation and/or enviroment. This led to my first job "Thank you Tannie Jeanette De Swartd" where I worked for the center for teaching and learning within my university as a lab assistent for two years. My role was to acquaint first year students with a reading program implemented by the university to aid students in improving their reading speed as well as their comprehensive skills. My role also consisted of recording marks, filing and placing students on the correct grades given the progress they have made. It was here where I learned to become more confident and outspoken as that was the main goal of attaining the job.
            Fast forward a  few  years later and I am now finishing my degree where I also picked up sufficient programming skills that enabled me to create the wonderful Technical CV that you are currently looking at.

        <h2>What to expect from me as an employee..</h2>
        <br>
        <p>To the recruitment team that may consider me a possible candidate. I share my experiences with you to show you that, my tenacity is one of my biggest strengths and even though I may experience failure, I never gave up and within these five years I learned to stay optimistic even though the odds were against me.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>So what can you expect from me?.Well, everything I shared with you up until this point should give you an indication of the type of person that I am. "NOT PERFECT, BUT WILLING"</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
